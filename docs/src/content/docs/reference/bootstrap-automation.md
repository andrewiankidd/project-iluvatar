title: '[WIP] Bootstrap Automation'
description: TODO

## About

I am a very lazy person and this drives me to automate everything. Additionally my memory is terrible and attempting to automate things not only drills it into my memory, but provides a form of practical documentation.

Like most code, it's about turning human actions into more efficient and reliable code, I guess it always has been.

With this project I aimed to automate most of it with Docker, but soon faced limitations on Windows.
So then I scripted an Ubuntu VM using Multipass, which is prepared via bash scripts to run Docker and beat those limitations.

To avoid Platform issues, I'd recommend just using the VM for bootstrapping - but all the real magic is in the Docker compose file and you can run that natively on Linux or Mac if you please.

:::caution[Manual Action]
This is a per device manual action, cannot be automated :(

[Before you continue, make sure you have updated your Pi's boot order to enable netboot](../../guides/netboot/1-pi-prep)

## Automation options

<!--
TODO other options for bootstrapping new nodes
TODO options to use sd cards with TFTP_IP instead of 'option 66'/dchp

new device added:
  with sd:
    full SD image:
      master node already already:
        boots up ready to go, as secondary master
      no master node:
        boots up, becomes master (runs tftp and nfs for others)
    tftp ip config image:
      boots up and goes onto netboot@configured_tftp_ip
    empty:
      goes on to netboot@dhcp_option66_tftp_ip
  without:
    goes on to netboot@dhcp_option66_tftp_ip

  ways to create new master node:
   - (Creating cluster) 'I want to bootstrap [...]'
   - (Existing cluster) In an existing cluster, boot a blank sd card inserted
   - (Existing cluster/NO TFTP) In an existing cluster, boot a TFTP_CONFIG sd card inserted

  ways to create new netboot node:
   - (Existing cluster) In an existing cluster, boot with no SD card

### I want to bootstrap from the network

<details>
<summary>Using VM (Recommended)</summary>

1. Pick an unused IP in your network (ie `192.168.0.66`)
2. Set the 'Option 66' config on your DHCP server to the selected IP
3. Update `bootstrap\netboot\.env`
   1. Set the `IP_ADDRESS` to the selected IP
   2. Set the `COMPOSE_PROFILE` to the desired value (`raspios`|`ubuntuserver`|`nobuild`)
4. Open a CLI and CD to `bootstrap\netboot`
5. Follow the 'Running' steps in [`vm/README.md`](https://github.com/andrewiankidd/project-iluvatar/blob/master/src/bootstrap/netboot/vm/README.md)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Using Docker</summary>

1. Don't be on Windows
2. Have Docker installed
3. Get your local network IP (ie `192.168.0.66`)
4. Set the 'Option 66' config on your DHCP server to the selected IP
5. Update `bootstrap\netboot\.env`
   1. Set the `IP_ADDRESS` to the selected IP
   2. Set the `COMPOSE_PROFILE` to the desired value (`raspios`|`nixos`|`nobuild`)
6. Open a CLI and CD to `bootstrap\netboot`
7. Run
    ```
    source .env
    docker compose --profile $COMPOSE_PROFILE up
    ```
