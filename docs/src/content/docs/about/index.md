### TODO: pic of cluster

## In Summary

 - I want to build a group of machines than can work as one system (cluster) 🖥️🖥️🖥️
   - Add and remove machines from the group without any configuration (scalable) 🤖
   - Run them with little maintenance (resiliency) 🔌
   - Manage everything remotely 📱
 - I want this system to be my private cloud and the brains of my house ☁️🧠🌐
   - Control my lights, cameras, etc 💡
   - Store and encrypt my personal data 🔒
   - Host my own sites, tools and services 🌐
   - Minecraft server, obviously ⛏️

## Background

My [last home server was a single machine running multiple virtual machines](https://andrewkidd.co.uk/blog/2021/04/01/Gideon-2/) and was handling all of this stuff great - but that when that machine has an issue, it takes everything down with it.

Depending on how nerdy you are this impacts you on different levels. If it's just your media server sure, whatever, but if it's also all of your Personal Documents, Backups, Passwords and other important data then it's a bit more serious.

It felt fickle in that respect, and then one day the PSU failed and it just felt like work. Not being able to depend on it reliably made it pointless and now over two years later it still sits powered down.

## Motivation

Fortunately, I can't help but tinker and the itch of having a home server again needs scratching.

The internet can be decentralized, users can own their own data, you can have privacy.

I have a vision of a modular, evolving server that allows me to achieve this

There a million ways to do this that cheaper, easier, simpler, more efficient and whatever else too, but where's the fun in that?
