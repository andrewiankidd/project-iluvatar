## What is it?
Project Ilúvatar documents the design and automation of a self-hosting Kubernetes platform.
Utilizing netboot, a single script can bootstrap a Raspberry Pi based cluster, which in turn provisions x86 workload clusters over PXE, with everything managed via GitOps - a complete bare-metal, immutable infrastructure built from scratch.

## Core Concepts

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Bare-Metal Automation" icon="server">
    End-to-end provisioning across mixed ARM and x86 hardware.
    PXE-booted nodes self-install, configure, and join the cluster without imaging or SSH.
  </Card>

  <Card title="PXE Bootstrapping" icon="rocket">
    Automated network boot via TFTP/HTTP.
    Bootstrap nodes host the infrastructure stack for self-replicating cluster creation.
  </Card>

  <Card title="GitOps" icon="github">
    All infrastructure and workloads defined declaratively in
    <a href="https://github.com/andrewiankidd/kidd-network">Git</a>.
    Argo CD ensures consistent, auditable cluster state.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Immutable Infrastructure" icon="approve-check-circle">
    Workload clusters run on <a href="https://www.talos.dev">Talos Linux</a> - secure, immutable, API-driven.
    Bootstrap services operate on ARM64 with k3s.

  <Card title="Distributed Storage & Backups" icon="cloud-download">
    <a href="https://longhorn.io">Longhorn</a> provides replicated block storage;
    <a href="https://velero.io">Velero</a> handles scheduled and on-demand backups.

  <Card title="Documentation" icon="open-book">
    Architecture, process, and lessons learned documented with
    <a href="https://starlight.astro.build/">Starlight</a> for reproducible workflows.
