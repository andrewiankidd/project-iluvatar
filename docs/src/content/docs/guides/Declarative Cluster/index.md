If like me you want to avoid running any commands at all to create your cluster, you might look at automating it as much as possible

Using NixOS and Netboot, you can plug a device with no storage into your network and have it start running services right away.

This guide goes over the creation of a completely declarative and reproducible Kubernetes cluster that can be managed in Git.

### Prerequisites
?? TODO
Read the Netboot guide if u havent eh

## Explanation

NixOS is a defsdf, configuration in git blah blah, gitops principles blah blah, self updating blah blah
